# Flappy Bird Clone

This is a clone of the classic game Flappy Bird, developed using [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_intro.php) and [Unity](https://unity.com/). The game follows the same mechanics as the original, where the player controls a bird by tapping the space bar to avoid pipes and score points by passing through gaps between them.
